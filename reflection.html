                Working on this project has been a highly educational experience, enhancing my understanding of combining the YOLO and SORT algorithms 
                for real-time object tracking. I gained insights into the YOLO algorithm, particularly the functionality of its backbone, Darknet-53. 
                Additionally, this project helped me sharpen my web development skills through the creation of a blog, which allowed me to effectively 
                document and share our progress. Overall, this project enriched my knowledge in computer vision and web development, providing a practical 
                application for my technical skills.

                In this project, I learned about the significant role AI and Machine Learning play in the global digital market and future development. 
                Specifically, I explored how AI can manage road traffic by detecting car speeds, counting vehicles, and predicting congestion. Additionally, 
                I discovered the benefits of using AI for video presentations, which helped me overcome my challenges with public speaking. Working on 
                this project also highlighted the importance of communication and teamwork for success. Overall, this experience has deepened my understanding 
                of AI and its potential to improve various aspects of our lives.

                Participating in this project has been a transformative experience. My role involved discussing the Unique Selling Proposition (USP), technology 
                and implementation strategies, revenue projections, and implementation plans. One major challenge was figuring out how to promote and attract 
                clients to our software. I overcame this by surveying friends to gather insights, which helped shape our promotional strategy. This process 
                improved my skills in promotion and client attraction, which will be valuable for future projects. Additionally, working on this project broadened 
                my perspective on AI, showing me how this advanced technology can solve complex problems like traffic congestion.

                What I learned in this project are how AI and Machine Learning play a major role and global digital Market as the technology keep advancing for 
                future development. This is including the application of AI in managing a road traffic control by detecting how the speed of car and counting the 
                number vehicle in road and it also can have prediction if the road may get congestion by measuring the number and speed of the vehicle in the road. 
                In this project I also learn how to use AI in presenting video by using AI voice. This make me realize the use of AI in video presentation was good 
                for me because as someone who have lacking in speaking, this helps a lot by using AI voice and using short animation and presentation slide to explain 
                the point. Lastly, I also see the communication and the cooperation of team member play a major role in project succession this also including in workplace.
